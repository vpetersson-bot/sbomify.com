## Introduction

Depending on the type of software you are producing, versioning may or may not be straightforward. The most widely known scheme is [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer), which encodes API compatibility into the version number (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). It works well for libraries and tools where consumers care about breaking changes. It is not the only established scheme, though. [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) (CalVer) derives version numbers from the release date instead, and is used by projects like Ubuntu (`24.04`) and pip. CalVer is a great fit when releases follow a time-based cadence rather than an API-compatibility contract, and it is what we use for sbomify itself. Either scheme gives you what matters for SBOMs: unique, ordered, human-readable version identifiers.

Neither model works as effectively for software delivered as a service, or anything with rolling releases. Many tech companies deploy new versions to production numerous times per day, and in this case, maintaining any hand-assigned version number creates a lot of friction.

Since SBOMs are directly related to software releases, the way you version and/or deploy your software will determine how you version your SBOM.

Both CycloneDX and SPDX recognize that the way you version your software is highly customized, and neither enforces any specific versioning scheme. Instead, they treat version identifiers as a text string. For clarity, when we discuss versioning, we are referring to the version of the top-level component (i.e., your software), not the document-level `version` field found in CycloneDX. If that distinction is new to you, read the next section carefully, as this is one of the most common mistakes people make with SBOMs.

## A Common Pitfall: The Top-Level `version` Field

If you are new to SBOMs and open up a CycloneDX document, the first `version` field you will see sits at the very top of the file, right next to `serialNumber`. It is tempting to put your software version there. Don't. That field versions the SBOM document itself, not the software it describes.

In CycloneDX, your software version belongs in [`metadata.component.version`](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#metadata_component), the top-level component that represents your application. The document-level [`version`](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#version) field exists for one narrow purpose: amending an SBOM you have already published. If you need to correct a published SBOM (say you discover a missing component or a licensing error), you keep the same [`serialNumber`](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#serialNumber) and increment the document `version` (1, 2, 3, and so on). The unchanged `serialNumber` tells consumers that both documents describe the same release, and the higher `version` tells them which one supersedes the other.

Amending should be an edge case. In the normal flow, every release of your software gets a brand-new SBOM: a freshly generated `serialNumber`, a document `version` of `1`, and your actual software version in `metadata.component.version`. That component version is what you (and anyone consuming your SBOMs) should be tracking from release to release. If your document `version` says anything other than `1` and you have not deliberately amended a published SBOM, something in your pipeline is misusing the field.

SPDX works the same way in spirit. Your software version goes in the [`versionInfo`](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/package-information/#73-package-version-field) field of the package your document describes, and each new document gets a unique [document namespace](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/document-creation-information/#65-spdx-document-namespace-field). SPDX has no built-in revision counter like CycloneDX. Instead, a correction is a new document that declares an [`AMENDS` relationship](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/relationships-between-SPDX-elements/) pointing back to the document it amends. Again, this is only for fixing an SBOM you have already published, not for shipping a new version of your software.

## Best Practices

One of the most authoritative documents on versioning SBOMs is CISA's [Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/SBOM%20Framing%20Software%20Component%20Transparency%202024.pdf). The document states the following about versioning:

_"The Version is a supplier-defined identifier that specifies an update change in the software from a previously identified version. This Attribute helps to further identify a Component and should be separate from the Component Name. As there is a wide range of versioning schemes in use, recording what is provided from the Supplier accurately is the primary goal. Semantic versioning is preferred._

_If the Component does not have a unique semantic version available to declare, make sure that a cryptographic hash is provided for the Component. Be aware that this will not indicate the relative release of the Component to its predecessors and successors. As a minimum expectation, declare the version string as provided by the Supplier."_

While CISA states a preference for Semantic Versioning, note that their primary goal is "recording what is provided from the Supplier accurately." A CalVer version satisfies this just as well as a SemVer one: both are unique, ordered version strings that identify a specific release. What matters is that you use a well-defined scheme consistently, whichever one fits your release process.

If you are creating your SBOMs in GitHub, you are likely using [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to manage releases, and this works identically whether your tags are SemVer (`v2.1.3`) or CalVer (`2026.07.1`). You can leverage these for SBOM versioning automatically. For instance, if you are using our [GitHub Actions Module](https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify-action), you can set `COMPONENT_VERSION` to `${{ github.ref_name }}`, which will then automatically populate the corresponding version you created.

However, if you are not using a versioning scheme at all, the document advises using a "cryptographic hash." Assuming your source code lives in a `git` repository, you can automatically derive a hash from there. If you are not using GitHub, you can use `git rev-parse HEAD` to get this. If you are using GitHub Actions (perhaps together with our GitHub Actions Module), you can then use `${{ github.sha }}` as a shorthand for this.

## When to Release SBOMs

The timing largely depends on when you are releasing your software. For instance, if you are using git tags for releases, this is likely when you want to trigger SBOM generation.

If you are using rolling releases, you may want to limit SBOM generation to production deployments. How you do this will vary greatly depending on your internal organization. In some cases, production corresponds to a specific git branch, while in other organizations, you "promote" what is in your staging environment to production.

Regardless of whether this is a merge from one branch to another or a build/release promotion, this is the point at which you want to generate the SBOM.

## Conclusion

If you're building SBOMs, please consider leveraging a well-defined versioning scheme, whether that is Semantic Versioning or Calendar Versioning, together with git tags. This approach will help ensure that your SBOM is accurate and reproducible.
