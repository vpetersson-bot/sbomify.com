tldr: "One container image runs everywhere. GitHub Actions gets a native action; every other runtime pulls ghcr.io/sbomify/sbomify-action and passes the same environment variables."
---

The tool is a CLI shipped as a container image. Configuration is environment variables, and they are **identical on every platform**. What changes between runtimes is only how you invoke the container, how you authenticate, and how much the platform tells the action about your build.

If your platform can run a container, it is supported - even if it does not have a page here. Start with [any container runner](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/docker/).

## Pick your platform

- [**GitHub Actions**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/github-actions/) - native action, OIDC trusted publishing, build provenance attestation
- [**GitLab CI**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/gitlab-ci/) - container image, automatic VCS detection, self-managed supported
- [**Bitbucket Pipelines**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/bitbucket/) - container image via a Docker pipe, automatic VCS detection
- [**Jenkins**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/jenkins/) - declarative and scripted pipelines
- [**CircleCI**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/circleci/) - container executor
- [**Azure DevOps**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/azure-devops/) - container job or Docker task
- [**TeamCity**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/teamcity/) - Docker Wrapper build feature or Kotlin DSL
- [**Any container runner**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/docker/) - Drone, Woodpecker, Buildkite, Concourse, or a plain shell
- [**Local machine**](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/local/) - `uvx`, `pipx` or Docker on your laptop

## What differs

| Runtime                                               | Integration     | Auth          | VCS auto-detect | Wizard             | Attestation |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| GitHub Actions                                        | Native action   | OIDC or token | Yes             | Generates workflow | Yes         |
| GitLab CI                                             | Container image | Token         | Yes             | No                 | No          |
| Bitbucket                                             | Container image | Token         | Yes             | No                 | No          |
| Jenkins                                               | Container image | Token         | Manual          | No                 | No          |
| CircleCI                                              | Container image | Token         | Manual          | No                 | No          |
| Azure DevOps                                          | Container image | Token         | Manual          | No                 | No          |
| Any container runner                                  | Container image | Token         | Manual          | No                 | No          |
| [TeamCity](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/teamcity/) | Container image | Token         | Git roots       | No                 | No          |
| Local machine                                         | `uvx` or `pipx` | Token         | Manual          | Yes                | No          |

**VCS auto-detect** means the action reads repository URL, commit SHA and branch from the environment without configuration. Where it says _Manual_, the platform does not expose that information in a standard enough form, so you set `vcs_url`, `vcs_commit_sha` and `vcs_ref` in [`sbomify.json`](/guides/sbomify-action/augmentation/#automatic-vcs-detection) instead. It is a few lines, and everything else behaves the same.

_Git roots_ is TeamCity's case: it is detected, but only when the repository URL positively identifies Git. TeamCity is VCS-agnostic and exposes no type information, so non-Git roots are skipped rather than recorded as commits. See [the TeamCity guide](/guides/sbomify-action/runtimes/teamcity/#vcs-information).

**OIDC trusted publishing** and **attestation** are GitHub-only today because both depend on GitHub-issued identity tokens. Other runtimes authenticate with an API token, and can sign with [cosign](/faq/how-do-i-sign-an-sbom/) rather than GitHub's provenance tooling. Support will expand as platforms expose equivalent primitives.

## The universal pattern

Every non-GitHub runtime is a variation on this:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/github/workspace" \
  -w /github/workspace \
  -e LOCK_FILE=requirements.txt \
  -e OUTPUT_FILE=sbom.cdx.json \
  -e ENRICH=true \
  -e UPLOAD=false \
  ghcr.io/sbomify/sbomify-action
```

Mount your repository, set the working directory, pass configuration as environment variables. The image entrypoint is `sbomify-action`, so no command is needed unless you want a subcommand such as `wizard` or `yocto`.

Whatever your platform's syntax for "run this container with these variables" is, that is your integration.

## Where the code lives

| Channel                  | Location                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source and GitHub Action | [`sbomify/sbomify-action`](https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify-action) |
| Container image          | `ghcr.io/sbomify/sbomify-action`                                      |
| Python package           | [`sbomify-action`](https://pypi.org/project/sbomify-action/)          |

One repository, one image. There is no per-platform integration to install or keep in sync.
